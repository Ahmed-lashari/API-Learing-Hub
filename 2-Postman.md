# Introduction to Postman and JSONPlaceholder

## What is Postman?

**Postman** is a freemium software tool used for **developing, testing, and documenting APIs**. It provides a powerful and user-friendly interface that helps developers simulate requests to servers and inspect responses in real time.

Postman is widely used in API development workflows for both frontend and backend developers.

## Features of Postman

1. **API Request Builder** – Easily craft and send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. **Response Viewer** – View detailed API responses including status codes, headers, and response time.
3. **Environment Support** – Manage multiple environments (development, staging, production) using variables.
4. **Collections** – Group related requests into collections for better organization and collaboration.
5. **Automation with Tests** – Write scripts to automate testing and validate responses.
6. **Mock Servers** – Simulate endpoints without needing a live backend.
7. **Collaboration Tools** – Share APIs and collections with teams using Postman’s cloud services.

## Why Do We Test APIs?

Testing APIs is a critical step in application development. Here’s why it matters:

* To **verify** that the API endpoint is working correctly.
* To **inspect** the data format returned (usually JSON).
* To **simulate user interactions** without needing to build the full frontend.
* To **debug** backend issues by viewing error codes and messages.
* To **understand API structure** (URL, method, headers, body, etc.).
* To **validate authentication** mechanisms (tokens, headers, etc.).

## Downloading Postman

Postman is available on all major operating systems:

* Visit the official website: [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
* Download the version suitable for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* Install and launch the application
* As simple as that.


> Postman also offers a web version for lightweight usage: [https://web.postman.co](https://web.postman.co)

## What is JSONPlaceholder?

**JSONPlaceholder** is a free online REST API service that provides fake data for testing and prototyping. It simulates a working backend with real API routes, allowing developers to practice working with APIs without setting up their own server.

### Features:

* Open and free to use without authentication
* Provides various resource types (users, posts, comments, todos, etc.)
* Mimics standard REST API behavior
* Useful for learning how to work with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests

### Example Endpoint:

```plaintext
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

### Sample Response:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Sample Title",
  "body": "This is a sample post body from JSONPlaceholder."
}
```

## Conclusion

Postman is an essential tool for testing and exploring APIs during development. Coupled with tools like JSONPlaceholder, it becomes easy to learn, simulate, and troubleshoot backend communication in your apps — especially when working on Flutter-based client applications.

In the next modules, we will practice using Postman to interact with real APIs and understand how to send and receive JSON data.
